# Hybrid Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning for Adaptive Cloud and DDoS Security

## Overview

This project is focused on developing a **Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect various network intrusions, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The IDS combines signature-based detection with anomaly-based detection to improve detection rates of both known and zero-day attacks.

The code includes several key stages: data preprocessing, feature selection, model training (with Decision Trees and Random Forest), hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and model evaluation.
